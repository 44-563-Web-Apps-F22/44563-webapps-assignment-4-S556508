FIA.           Though obedience is strong,
            Curiosity's stronger—
       We waited for long,
            Till we couldn't wait longer.<br>

VIT.           It's imprudent, we know,
            But without your society
       Existence was slow,
            And we wanted variety—<br>

BOTH.     Existence was slow, and we wanted variety.<br>

ALL.      So here we are, at the risk of our lives,
  From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—
  And to that end we've crossed the main,
  And don't intend to return again!<br>

TESS.          As at home we've been remaining—
            We've not seen you both for ages,<br>
GIA.           Tell me, are you fond of reigning?—
            How's the food, and what's the wages?<br>
TESS.          Does your new employment please ye?—<br>
GIA.                How does Royalizing strike you?<br>
TESS.          Is it difficult or easy?—<br>
GIA.                Do you think your subjects like you?<br>
